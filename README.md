# GoldenOldies -- Software from pre-git publications

In the spirit of reproducible research, the Kolaczyk research group has generally aimed to create and freely distribute prototype software implementations of the methodologies developed in our research work. Since roughly 2015, we have aimed to distribute consistently through the group’s Github pages, with one repo per project. The older stuff is available here through this single git repo. 

Please note that while we have done our best to comment the code sufficiently and test it, this is being made available `as is’. There have been no attempts to maintain the software, for example in terms of compatability with successive releases of the Matlab or alternate operating systems. Nor is any promise of `support’ being made in releasing the code, although of course I will answer any questions as best I can. Therefore, as the saying goes, caveat emptor.
